# Mason City Reverside Budget

#### 2020-08-27

## Instruction

> In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports (swimming, boating and fishing) among their favorite recreational activities. The Mason River flowing through the city is rarely used for these pursuits, however, and the city park department devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside recreational facilities. For years there have been complaints from residents about the quality of the river's water and the river's smell. In response, the state has recently announced plans to clean up Mason River. Use of the river for water sports is therefore sure to increase. The city government should for that reason devote more money in this year's budget to riverside recreational facilities.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on the assumptions and what the implications are if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

## Thoughts

1. that the survey provides a reliable basis for budget planning
2. that the riverâ€™s pollution and odor are the only reasons for its limited recreational use
3. that efforts to clean the water and remove the odor will be successful
