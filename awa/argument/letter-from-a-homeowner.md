## Instruction

The following appeared in a letter from a homeowner to a friend.

> Of the two leading real estate firms in our town — Adams Realty and Fitch Realty — Adams Realty is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate agents; in contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time. Moreover, Adams' revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch's $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: ten years ago I listed my home with Fitch, and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams Realty.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

## Thoughts

1. The aganet number is not necessarily related to their servcie quality.
2. We may not compare the average sales prices, since they are different houses.
3. The comparison of the time needed to sale a house is based on different period. 

## Sample Essay

The author compares two real estate firms - Adams Realty and Fitch Realty - based on four factors: the number of agents, annual revenue, average sold price and how many time does it take to sell an object. Fitch Realty wins on all these four metrics, therefore the author suggest his friend to do business with Fitch Realty when his  friend would like to sell a house. At a first glimpse, it seems reasonable, but we need to further exam if these metrics are calculated fairly and do they suitable to be used to judge how well the service is when choosing a real state agent.

Let's discuss the first metrics - the number of agents. Indeed, Fitch Realty has  almost twice as much agents compared with Adams Realty. However, we should also consider how much cases does a agent has. If the ratio is too high, then the agent can not put too much time to sell each one of clients' house.

The annual revenue is the index of how well a realty is running, but not necessary how well there service would be. A realty with high revenue may charge their customer more and not necessarily providing the corresponding service. And even more, Fitch Realty has a lower annual revenue per agent.

When it comes to the average sold price, what really matters is the sold price compared to the neighbors with similar house condition, such as the number of rooms, etc. It's possible Fitch Realty sold high-end houses with larger discount, and hurt the customer benefit.

Last but not least is the time needed to sell a house. The author compared his experience with these two realty companies in different period. Although Adams Realty use more time to sell the author's house, but that happened 10 years ago, we should investigate if the realty market is not that good then. The author also mentioned that the price is also better with Fitch Realty, but maybe the second house is in a better condition then the first one.
