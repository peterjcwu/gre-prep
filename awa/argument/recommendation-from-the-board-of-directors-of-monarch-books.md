# Recommendation From the Board of Directors of Monarch Books

#### 2020-07-30

## Instruction

The following is a recommendation from the Board of Directors of Monarch Books.

> We recommend that Monarch Books open a café in its store. Monarch, having been
> in business at the same location for more than twenty years, has a large customer
> base because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects. 
> Clearly, opening the café would attract more customers. Space could be made for
> the café by discontinuing the children's book section, which will probably become
> less popular given that the most recent national census indicated a significant 
> decline in the percentage of the population under age ten. Opening a café will
> allow Monarch to attract more customers and better compete with Regal Books,
> which recently opened its own café.
